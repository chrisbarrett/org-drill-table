# org-drill-table

## Summary

Some types of information, such as vocabulary lists, yearn to be represented in
tables. However, org-drill requires individual headlines with the "drill" tag;
creating these can be laborious and it is difficult to get an overview of your
cards when the buffer is folded.

This package provides a command, `org-drill-table-generate`, that will generate
drill cards based on an org-mode table in the current subtree. The cards will
inserted under a new "Cards" heading in the current tree.

For example, given the following org headline,

```org
* Vocab
| English   | Spanish |
|-----------+---------|
| Today     | Hoy     |
| Yesterday | Ayer    |
| Tomorrow  | Mañana  |
```

invoking `org-drill-table-generate` will generate cards for each table row:

```org
* Vocab
:PROPERTIES:
:DRILL_HEADING: Noun
:DRILL_CARD_TYPE: twosided
:DRILL_INSTRUCTIONS: Translate the following word.
:END:
| English   | Spanish |
|-----------+---------|
| Today     | Hoy     |
| Yesterday | Ayer    |
| Tomorrow  | Mañana  |
** Cards
*** Noun                                                            :drill:
:PROPERTIES:
:DRILL_CARD_TYPE: twosided
:END:
Translate the following word.
**** English
Today
**** Spanish
Hoy
*** Noun                                                            :drill:
:PROPERTIES:
:DRILL_CARD_TYPE: twosided
:END:
Translate the following word.
**** English
Yesterday
**** Spanish
Ayer
*** Noun                                                            :drill:
:PROPERTIES:
:DRILL_CARD_TYPE: twosided
:END:
Translate the following word.
**** English
Tomorrow
**** Spanish
Mañana
```

`org-drill-table-generate` checks the existing list of cards so it does not add
duplicates.

This package provides an additional command, `org-drill-table-update`, which can
be added to `org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook`.
